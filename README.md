# Regression Assignment – California Housing Dataset

This project applies different regression algorithms to the California Housing dataset using scikit-learn.  
The goal is to compare model performance and understand how different regression techniques behave on real-world data.

## Contents
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Implementation of 5 regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Model evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score
- Comparison of best and worst performing models

## Summary
Random Forest performed the best because it captures complex patterns and reduces errors by combining many trees.  
Linear Regression performed the worst because it assumes straight-line relationships, which do not fit this dataset well.
